# DD2410
Assignments + Project for robotics course KTH

Current problems:

1. Can't use Kattis to check solutions. Contacted staff, said that certain (vital) python libraries were not availible during the summer.

2. Planning algorithm (A*) behaves unexpectedly with obstacles. Will try to implement a discrete (grid) map, and see if that fixes the issues. Currently working on this lab.

3. Mapping algorithm have not yet attempted C part.
