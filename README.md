# DD2410
Assignments + Project for robotics course KTH

Current problems:

1. Assignment 2 part E runtime error in Kattis (CHECKED: staff said imported packages except for dfault python aren't supported as of now during summer)

2. Old assignment 2 fix (part E) needs to be sorted out, changed math as a temp. fix

3. Kinematics part C problems with the inverse solution for KUKA robot (DONE-ZO)

4. Assignment 3 possible current problems: pointer for node "current" might be recursively sent back, resulting in endless loop. Also, cost function could be off, resulting in car never wanting to change position as it would cost more than staying at spawn point.

5. Assignment 3 visited list could be changed to hash table implementation for performance boost (DONE)

6. Assignment 4 raytracing needs to be implemented
