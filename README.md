# DD2410
Assignments + Project for robotics course KTH

Current problems:

1. Assignment 2 part E runtime error in Kattis

2. Old assignment 2 fix needs to be sorted out, changed math as a temp. fix

3. Assignment 3 possible current problems: pointer for node "current" might be recursively sent back, resulting in endless loop. Also, cost function could be off, resulting in car never wanting to change position as it would cost more than staying at spawn point.

4. Assignment 3 visited list could be changed to hash table implementation for performance boost
