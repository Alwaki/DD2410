# DD2410
Assignments + Project for robotics course KTH

Current Status:

ROS: Finished rudimentary part (so ready for presentation), however not implemented a more sophisticated action server. Probably not going to, as I've read all the theory and no further credit is given in the course for implementing it.

KINEMATICS: Finished kinematics problem, E and C parts are completed. Ready for turnin, but Kattis is not yet functional with additional python libraries. Supposed to be fixed at end of summer according to staff.

PLANNING: Changed algorithm from A* to RRT. Current implementation of algorithm has been able to solve 12/12 cases consistently.

MAPPING: Finished part E, however not yet attempted to implement part C.

PROJECT: A part finished and presented, might upload later.
